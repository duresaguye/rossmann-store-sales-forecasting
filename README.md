Rossmann Store Sales Forecasting

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting daily sales for Rossmann stores. By leveraging historical sales data, promotions, and other influencing factors, we aim to build predictive models to assist store managers in making informed decisions.
Project Overview

Rossmann, one of Germany's largest drug store chains, operates over 3,000 stores in 7 European countries. Accurately forecasting daily sales is crucial for inventory management, staffing, and strategic planning. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict sales up to six weeks in advance, considering various factors such as promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and locality.

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Install the required packages using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Data

Due to file size constraints, the dataset is not included in this repository. You can obtain the data from the Kaggle Rossmann Store Sales competition. After downloading, place the CSV files in the data/ directory.
Running the Analysis

    Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
        Use the notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to explore and preprocess the data.
        Execute the preprocessing scripts in the scripts/ directory to clean and prepare the data for modeling.

    Model Training:
        Run the model training notebooks to develop predictive models.
        Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

    Prediction:
        Use the trained models to forecast future sales.
        Analyze the predictions and validate their accuracy.

Project Highlights

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Assessed the distribution of promotions between training and test sets.
        Analyzed sales behavior before, during, and after holidays.
        Identified seasonal purchasing patterns during events like Christmas and Easter.

    Feature Engineering:
        Examined the correlation between sales and the number of customers.
        Evaluated the impact of promotions on both new and existing customers.
        Investigated the effect of store assortment types on sales.
        Analyzed the influence of competitor proximity and the opening of new competitors.

    Modeling:
        Implemented various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost.
        Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
        Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

Results

The final model achieved a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of X% on the test set, indicating accurate predictions of daily sales for Rossmann stores. These forecasts can aid in inventory management, staffing, and strategic decision-making.
Future Work

    Model Enhancement:
        Incorporate additional external data sources, such as economic indicators and weather data, to improve prediction accuracy.
        Explore advanced modeling techniques, including neural networks and ensemble methods.

    Deployment:
        Develop a user-friendly interface for store managers to access sales forecasts.
        Implement real-time prediction capabilities to adapt to changing conditions.
